# Currency Peg
The unit of currency transacted on the  Mason network is the Mason dollar. The value of a Mason dollar is [pegged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange-rate_system) to the USD. Mason nodes track exchange rates and create new currency only when deemed necessary to maintain the peg.
